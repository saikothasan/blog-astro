# Web Performance Tips for 2024

Performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here are essential tips to optimize your web applications.

## Core Web Vitals

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
   - Optimize image loading
   - Implement proper caching
   - Use CDN for assets

2. **First Input Delay (FID)**
   - Minimize JavaScript execution
   - Break up long tasks
   - Optimize event handlers

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
   - Set image dimensions
   - Reserve space for dynamic content
   - Avoid inserting content above existing content

## Implementation Examples

```javascript
// Lazy load images
<img 
  loading="lazy"
  src="image.jpg"
  width="800"
  height="600"
  alt="Description"
/>

// Use async/defer for scripts
<script async src="analytics.js"></script>
```

Remember: Performance is not a one-time task but an ongoing process of optimization and monitoring.
